OSX BuildSlave
==============

When initially setting up your buildslave you should start it
up and run it as per the buildbot setup documentation.

However when you want to start running it permanently, your
natural tendency is to log into the OSX host, start the buildslave
and then log back out again. As soon as you log out of the
host your security context is destroyed. The side effect of this
is the build slave loses all access to DNS. This is seen in the logs
as follows

"could not lookup DNS configuration info service: (ipc/send) invalid destination port"

and it causes all your builds to start failing (which is really annoying).

This problem is listed in the buildbot FAQ (http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/FAQ)
The work around to this is to run the build slave under launchd as described
here (http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/UsingLaunchd)

The file ''net.buildbot.slave.mythtv.plist'' is a buildslave plist file for use
with launchd. You should put it into /Library/LaunchDaemons on your OSX host.

You can then tell launchd about that file with the command
''launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.buildbot.slave.mythtv.plist''

The buildslave can then be started with
''launchctl start net.buildbot.slave.mythtv''

To restart the buildslave you need to kill the twistd process
and launchd will automatically restart it.


Happy Building!
